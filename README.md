# University of Milano-Bicocca Projects
Collection of all projects developed during the MSc in Data Science at the University of Milano-Bicocca: each project contains the code and the technical report.

## EMOTIC
- Context Based Emotion Recognition using Transfer Learning in Tensorflow
- Given an input image, the network identifies the relative bounding box and predicts the three continuous dimensions of emotions: Valence, Arousal and Dominance
- Project for the exam of "Foundations of Deep Learning"
- [Here](EMOTIC/) you can find the code and the report

## Influencers News
- Data acquisition and integration system to quantify the influence of news agencies on the growth of Instagram followers of the top 100 Italian influencers using docker compose, python, mongodb and tableau visualization
- Project for the exam of "Data Management and Visualization"
- [Here](InfluencersNews/) you can find the code and the report

## SpotifyTop200
- Descriptive and inferential analysis of Spotify top 200 songs between 2017-2021 in R
- Project for the exam of "Foundations of Probability and Statistics"
- [Here](SpotifyTop200/) you can find the report

## RDPb: machine learning approach to flow-based brute-force attacks detection
- Supervised machine learning model that allows to distinguish legitimate RDP traffic from brute-force attempts analyzing each individual TCP flow in terms of packet and session based features with F1 score of 0.9996
- Project for the exam of "Machine Learning"
- [Here](RDPb/ML_Project.pdf) you can find the paper
