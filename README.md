# University of Milano-Bicocca Projects
Collection of all projects developed during the MSc in Data Science at the University of Milano-Bicocca: each project contains the code and the technical report.

## EMOTIC
- Context Based Emotion Recognition using Transfer Learning in Tensorflow: given an input image, the network identifies the relative bounding box and predicts the three continuous dimensions of emotions: Valence, Arousal and Dominance
- Project for the exam of "Fondation of Deep Learning"
- [Here](EMOTIC/) you can find the code and the report

## Influencers News
- Data acquisition and integration system to quantify the influence of news agencies on the growth of Instagram followers of the top 100 Italian influencers using docker compose, python, mongodb and tableau visualization
- Project for the exam of "Data Management and Visualization"
- [Here](InfluencersNews/) you can find the code and the report

## Life Index
- Integration and analysis of data to quantify the quality of life in the world: definition of an index, clustering of similar nations, forecasting future trends using time series.
