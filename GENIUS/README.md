# Genius Song Lyrics

## About The Project

This project delves into the world of song lyrics, exploiting the potential of text mining techniques to extract meaningful information from the [Kaggle Genius Song Lyrics dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosgdcj/genius-song-lyrics-with-language-information).
By integrating topic modelling and text classification methods, the primary goal is to build a predictive model capable of determining genre, identifying relevant topics, and suggesting similar songs based solely on the textual content of a given song.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites 
1. Python version between *3.8* and *3.11*
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Only if you want to change the dataset loading [settings](README.md#settings)
   1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosgdcj/genius-song-lyrics-with-language-information)
   2. Unzip it
   3. Place it in the `data` folder

### Usage

You can execute the project by running the entire *TextMining.ipynb* notebook.

### Settings

You can change certain project parameters by modifying the constants defined in the first cell of the notebook.

#### Dataset loading
- `LANG`: the language of the dataset used for filtering the dataset, by default is set to "italian".
- `LANG_CODE`: the language code used for filtering the dataset, by default is set to "it".
- `DECADES`: a list of decades used for filtering the dataset, by default it includes all the decades between 1950 and 2020.
- `RELOAD_DATASET`: a flag indicating whether to reload the dataset or use the existing one if available, by default is set to False.
- `FORCE_PREPROCESSING`: a flag indicating whether to force the preprocessing of the dataset or use the preprocessed version if available, by default is set to False.
- `TEST_SIZE`: the proportion of the dataset to be used for testing, by default is set to 0.2 (20%).

#### Topic modeling
- `FORCE_TOPIC_MODELING`: a flag indicating whether to force the topic modeling process or use the existing model if available, by default is set to False.
- `NUM_TOPICS`: the number of topics to be generated by the topic modeling algorithm, by default is set to 30.
- `PASSES`: the number of passes or iterations for the topic modeling algorithm, by default is set to 15.
- `SHOW_GUI`: a flag indicating whether to show the graphical interface for visualizing the topic modeling results, by default is set to False.

#### Classification
- `FORCE_CLASSIFICATION`: a flag indicating whether to force the training of the classification model or use the existing model if available, by default is set to False.
- `MAX_FEATURES`: the maximum number of features to be considered in the classification model, by default is set to 100,000.
